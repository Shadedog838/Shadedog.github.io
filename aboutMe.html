Following the divorce Shandons mom took Shandon and moved into a house in Springfield, Queens NY. As a child Shandon loved playing with his collection of toys and watching cartoons like Spongbob. Pre-school was very fun for Shandon,who met a lot friends, but he will forget about them when going to elementary school.

    Shandon attended middle school at Eagle Academy for Young Men. He hated the school mainly because it was an all boys school.During his sixth grade year Shandon had a hard time passing his classes because he wasn't use to how different middle school is from elementary school . However, during his seventh grade year shandon started doing well. He started passing classes with honors and makimg a lot of friends. In his eighth grade year every class became really easy. However, Shandon had to take a regents exam at the end of the year in science. Science was a very boring class for Shandon and it was hard for him to gather information. Shandon eventually took saturday clases in order to fully prepare for the regents. In the end he managed to pass and got accepted into a high school of his choosing.
